Coordinate Systems:
    The coordinate system on a PDF page is called User Space.
    This is a flat 2-dimensional space, just like a piece of paper.
    And in fact that's a good way to think about it. The units of User Space
    are called "points" and there are 72 points/inch. The origin, or 0,0 point
    is located in the bottom left hand corner of the page. Horizontal,
    or X, coordinates increase to the rights and vertical, or Y, coordinates
    increase towards the top.
    NOTE: take into account, that in MuPDFâ€™s coordinate system, the y-axis
    is oriented from top to bottom. So, the origin 0,0 point is located at
    the top left corner.
